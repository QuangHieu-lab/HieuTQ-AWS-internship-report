# Summary Report: AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering.

### Event Objectives

- Share best practices in modern application design
- Introduce Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and event-driven architecture
- Provide guidance on selecting the right compute services
- Present AI tools to support the development lifecycle

### Speakers

- **Toan Huynh** –  AI-Driven Development Life Cycle & Amazon Q Developer Expert
- **My Nguyen** – Sr. GTM Specialist, AppMod
### Coordinators
- **Diem My** - Event Coordinator
- **Dai Truong** - Technical Coordinator
- **Dinh Nguyen** - Workshop Coordinator


### Key Highlights

####  Introducing AI-Driven Development Lifecycle
- To explore how Amazon Q Developer and Kiro can modernize software development through AI-enhanced coding and workflow automation.


#### Amazon Q Developer Integration

-A practical walkthrough of Amazon Q Developer, showcasing its abilities in automated code generation, real-time debugging, streamlined testing, and effortless documentation creation.

#### Kiro AI platform

- A look into how Kiro’s AI-powered environment is built and how it blends into everyday development workflows to boost efficiency and code quality.


#### AI Integration 

- **Start small**: Test these tools on small, trial projects first to see if they actually help.
- **Set rule**: Make sure there are clear rules on how to treat code written by a machine.
- **Human Check**: Always have a human developer review and approve what the AI writes.

#### Technical that we are using

- **Amazon Q Developer:** This is our assistant that will help us take time to write code by 35% to 50%
- **Kiro:**: Another smart assistant that will check the quality of code and suggests improvement


#### The benefits we gain 

- **Speed**: Help us spend less time in working and can focus on other thing  
- **Enhance Quality**:It acts like a spell-checker for code, finding errors or suggesting better ways to write things in real-time.



#### The Key Takeaways


### Event Experience

Attending the **“AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering”** giving me extends perspective about AI and How we can use it correctly. Key experiences included:

#### Using AI in correct way and strategy
-**Test Drive First**: Start with small projects to prove the tools actually work before using them everywhere.
- **Set the Rules**: Create clear guidelines on how to write and check AI code so everyone does it the same way
-**Human Safety check** Never let the AI work alone. Always have a human review the code to catch mistakes.
   
#### Improving the Workflow
- **Fits Right In**: These tools plug directly into the software we already use (IDEs) and our automated testing systems (CI/CD), so we don't have to change our whole process.
- **Real-Time Advice**: You get suggestions and fixes instantly while you type, not hours later.
- **Automatic Paperwork**: The AI handles the boring stuff—like writing documentation—so the code is easier to maintain later.
#### Personal Experience
- Amazon Q was impressive because not only give us solution but also solve hard coding in real-time.
- Kiro showed me that AI isn't just for writing code—it's great for keeping the whole team aligned and productive
