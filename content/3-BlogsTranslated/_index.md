###  [Blog 2 - Compaction support for Avro and ORC file formats in Apache Iceberg tables in Amazon S3](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog talks the new automatic compaction support for Avro and ORC file formats in Apache Iceberg tables on Amazon S3. It explains why compaction is essential for maintaining performance in large-scale data lakes—especially when dealing with billions of streaming events, small-file issues, and real-time ingestion workloads. The article also compares Parquet, ORC, and Avro formats, and shows how S3 Tables now optimizes all three through automated maintenance. You’ll learn how the team tested the feature using a simulated IoT ingestion pipeline, how to set up the environment using S3 Tables, EMR Serverless, MSK, and Athena, and how compaction significantly improved query performance. Finally, the blog highlights that fully managed optimization is now available for Iceberg tables across S3, helping organizations reduce cost, improve query latency, and simplify lakehouse operations.

###  [Blog 3 -Accenture scales video analysis with Amazon Nova and Amazon Bedrock Agents](3.3-Blog3/)
