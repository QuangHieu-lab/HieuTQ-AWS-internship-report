This post was written with Ilan Geller, Kamal Mannar, Debasmita Ghosh, and Nakul Aggarwal of Accenture.

Video highlights offer a powerful way to boost audience engagement and extend content value for content publishers. These short, high-impact clips capture key moments that drive viewer retention, amplify reach across social media, reinforce brand identity, and open new avenues for monetization. However, traditional highlight creation workflows are slow and labor-intensive. Editors must manually review footage, identify significant moments, cut clips, and add transitions or narration—followed by manual quality checks and formatting for distribution. Although this provides editorial control, it creates bottlenecks that don’t scale efficiently.

This post showcases how [Accenture Spotlight](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-6b26i5zq6ko3e?sr=0-16&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) delivers a scalable, cost-effective video highlight generation solution using [Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/vi/ai/generative-ai/nova/) and [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/vi/bedrock/agents/). Amazon Nova foundation models (FMs) deliver frontier intelligence and industry-leading price-performance. With Spotlight, content owners can configure AI models and agents to support diverse use cases across the media industry while offering a human-in-the-loop option for quality assurance and collaborative refinement. This maintains accuracy, editorial oversight, and alignment with brand guidelines—without compromising on speed or scalability.reorder or rename columns.

## Real-world use cases

Spotlight has been applied across a range of industry scenarios, including:

* Personalized short-form video generation – Spotlight’s specialized agents analyze popular short-form content (such as video reels and other social media) to identify patterns of high-performing content. The agents then apply this understanding to long-form video to generate personalized short clips, with built-in checks for brand alignment and content standards.

* Sports editing and highlights – Spotlight automates creation of video highlights for sports like soccer, Formula 1, and rugby, tailoring them to specific user preferences and interests. It also validates each highlight’s quality and accuracy, streamlining editorial workflows as a result.

* Content matching for stakeholders – Using enriched metadata, Spotlight matches archived or live video content to audience demographics, optimizing distribution strategies and maximizing advertiser value through precise targeting.

* Real-time retail offer generation – In retail environments such as gas stations, Spotlight processes live CCTV footage to infer customer profiles using data (such as vehicle type or transaction history), and then dynamically generates personalized product offers. These offers consider contextual factors such as time of day and weather; and they are delivered with custom visuals in near real time.

## Spotlight’s architecture
Spotlight’s architecture addresses the challenge of scalable video processing, efficiently analyzing and generating content while maintaining speed and quality. It incorporates both task-specific models and Amazon Nova FMs that are orchestrated by specialized Amazon Bedrock agents. Key architectural highlights include:
* Task-driven model selection – Spotlight dynamically selects between traditional AI models and Amazon Nova FMs based on a given task’s complexity and latency requirements. This intelligent orchestration enables fast inference for time-sensitive operations while deploying deeper multimodal reasoning where sophisticated analysis is needed—balancing speed and intelligence across applications from real-time retail offers to complex video processing.

* Agent orchestration – Specialized agents, each purpose-built for specific analysis tasks, operate across the end-to-end workflow under the direction of a central orchestrator agent. The orchestrator agent manages task breakdown, data flow, and inter-agent communication.

* Scalable and adaptable – By using AWS capabilities, Spotlight’s architecture is configurable to support different workloads—from high-throughput video highlight generation to low-latency offer personalization at the edge.

Spotlight uses a multi-layered agent workflow to automate video processing and generation while maintaining quality control. For example, to generate dynamic video highlights, Spotlight uses three specialized “super agents” that work in coordination under a central orchestrator agent’s supervision. Each super agent is powered by Amazon Nova models, and is supported by a collection of utility agents (see the following diagram). These agents work together to understand video content, generate high-quality highlights, and maintain alignment with user requirements and brand standards.

![Workflow](/images/3-Blog/accenture.png)The workflow consists of the following super agents and utility agents:

* Video processing agent – This agent analyzes long-form video and generates detailed metadata to guide short-form video creation. It uses the following utility agents:
 
  * Research agent – Analyzes popular short-form videos to identify key components that create video virality, and creates recipes for successful short-form content. For example, in music videos, it can highlight choreographed dance sequences with the lead performer as essential segments and a recipe based on this insight.

  * Visual analysis agent – Applies the research agent’s findings to new long-form content. It identifies matching segments, tags key individuals, and timestamps relevant moments. It uses traditional AI models (such as person recognition and tracking) to capture fine-grained details for segment identification.
  
  * Audio analysis agent – Performs speech diarization and transcription to support both the research and visual analysis agents with deeper context from the video’s audio track.
  
* Short video generation agent – This agent orchestrates the actual creation of the short-form video by integrating relevant segments and refining the sequence. Its utility agents include:
  
  * Section of interest (SOI) agent – Identifies potential segments based on video genre, target length, featured performers, and JSON metadata from the visual analysis agent. This agent prioritizes logical flow and viewer engagement.
  
  * Video generation agent – Constructs video using segment recommendations and component patterns from the video processing agent. For example, influencer videos might follow a structure of an attention-grabbing hook, key messages, and a call to action. The process will be iteratively improved based on feedback from the reviewer agent.
  
  * Video postprocessing agent – Refines the final output for publishing by performing tasks like cropping to mobile-friendly aspect ratios, or adding subtitles, background music, and brand overlays.
  
* Reviewer agent – This agent works iteratively with the generation agent to maintain video quality and relevance. Its utility agents include:
  * Relevance check agent – Evaluates alignment with user-defined content guidelines, audience expectations, and desired themes.
  
  * Abruptness check agent – Provides smooth transitions between segments to avoid jarring cuts, enhancing viewer experience and professionalism.

## Solution overview

To interact with Spotlight, users access a frontend UI where they provide natural language input to specify their objective. Spotlight then employs its agentic workflow powered by Amazon Nova to achieve its given task. The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture for video highlight generation.

![Solution-Diagram](/images/3-Blog/accenture-solution.png) 

The workflow consists of the following key components (as numbered in the preceding diagram):
